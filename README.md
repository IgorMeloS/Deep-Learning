# Deep Learning

In this folder, I present some Deep Learning models that are part of my training. 

In this field, we have different applicability that require different algorithm models. Some of these algorithms are presented here according with type of problem. The Deep Learning models covered in this folder are: Artificial Neuron Network, Convolution Neuron Network, Deep Natural Language Processing, Recurrent Neural Network.
This repository is organized in the follow order


## [1 - Artificial Neuron Network - ANN](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Artifical%20Neuron%20Networks)
## [2 - Convolutional Neuron Network](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Convolutional%20Neuron%20Networks)
## [3 - Recurrent Neuron Network]()
## [4 - Deep Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Deep-Learning/tree/master/3%20-%20Deep%20Natural%20Language%20Processing)


### Note: All folders above contain commented codes inside the each folder. I donâ€™t present a  mathematical explanation of each algorithm, it is not the objective here, but I write briefly how I understand the algorithm and how I apply it in Python.
